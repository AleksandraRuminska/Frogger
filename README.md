# Frogger

My version of the popular arcade game "Frogger" from the 1980s with the possibility to store the highest scores in top scores records.  Made as a project for one of the classes at University. It was written in C with the use of the SDL library.
The project contains the code, CMakeLists.txt file and the folder resources with sprites, bmp files. Most of these sprites were created by me.
