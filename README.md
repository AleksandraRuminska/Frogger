# Frogger

My version of the popular arcade game "Frogger" from the 1980s, originally made as a project for one of the classes at University. It was written in C with the use of the SDL library. It also allows to store top scores of the players.
The project contains the code, CMakeLists.txt file and the folder resources with sprites, bmp files. Most of these sprites were created by me.
